# Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal projects repository! This space is a collection of projects I've worked on to practice and demonstrate various programming concepts. The projects range from simple to intermediate levels and showcase both **local applications** and **web-based solutions**.

## Topics Covered
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- **Method Calls**: Organizing code into reusable and efficient functions/methods.
- **API Integration**: Fetching and working with data from external APIs.
- **Basic to Intermediate Features**: Covering foundational to more advanced programming techniques.

## Project Types
- **Local Applications**: Console-based programs or standalone scripts.
- **Web-Based Projects**: Web applications showcasing dynamic content and interactivity.

These projects reflect my journey in programming and serve as a portfolio of the skills I've developed over time.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or use the ideas as inspiration for your own work!
